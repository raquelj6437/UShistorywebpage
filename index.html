                    <h1>Period 1</h1>
                    <h3>(1491 – 1607)</h3>
                    <p>Key Concept 1.1: As native populations migrated and settled across the vast expanse of North America over time, they developed distinct and increasingly complex societies by adapting to and transforming their diverse environments.
                        <br><br>Key Concept 1.2: Contact among Europeans, Native Americans, and Africans resulted in the Columbian Exchange and significant social, cultural, and political changes on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
                </div>
                <div id='period2' class='periods'>
                    <h1>Period 2</h1>
                    <h3>(1607-1754)</h3>
                    <p>Key Concept 2.1: Europeans developed a variety of colonization and migration patterns, influenced by different imperial goals, cultures, and the varied North American environments where they settled, and they competed with each other
                        and American Indians for resources.
                        <br><br> Key Concept 2.2: The British colonies participated in political, social, cultural, and economic exchanges with Great Britain that encouraged both stronger bonds with Britain and resistance to Britain’s control.<br><br>Key
                        Concept 2.3: European colonization efforts in North America stimulated intercultural contact and intensified conflict between the various groups of colonizers and native peoples.</p>

                <div id='period3' class='periods'>
                    <h1>Period 3</h1>
                    <h3>(1754-1800)</h3>
                    <p>Key Concept 3.1: British attempts to assert tighter control over its North American colonies and the colonial resolve to pursue self-government led to a colonial independence movement and the Revolutionary War.
                        <br><br> Key Concept 3.2: The American Revolution’s democratic and republican ideals inspired new experiments with different forms of government.
                        <br><br> Key Concept 3.3: Migration within North America and competition over resources, boundaries, and trade intensified conflicts among peoples and nations.</p>
                    <li>Abigail Adams, who was married to John Adams, wanted expansion of women’s rights after the colonies had won the revolution. She asked for protections against abusive and tyrannical men. Before this, women were continuously oppressed
                        simply because of their gender and had no protections under the law. The demands of women after the war to be given more rights is one of the first examples of women fighting for gender equality. It shows how the revolution resulted
                        in cultural and societal changes.</li>
                    <li>Common Sense was a means of propaganda written by Thomas Paine, and it aimed to alter American outlook on the war. He wanted to show people that they should be angry at the English Constitution and the king rather than just Parliamentary
                        measures. This makes it evident that the king was an easy target for blame when the colonies wanted to easily point a finger at someone. It increased tensions between the colonies and Britain, resulting in fewer relations.</li>
                    <li>Daniel Shays was a former captain in the continental army. Poor farmers in Massachusetts were upset about the high taxes that put them in debt and how it put them at risk for losing their land or being imprisoned. Shays issued a set
                        a demands to lower taxes, relocate the state capital, abolish imprisonment for debt, and a system of paper money. The government did not listen, resulting in various protests. This rebellion reveals how the economy was affected
                        by the war and the development of justice as a value within the United States.</li>
                    <li>The Declaration of Independence was written in 1776 to declare the colonies’ independence from Britain. It declared the colonies as 13 separate states (countries). This affected the colonies relationship with Britain since they no
                        longer wanted to be under its rule.</li>
                    <li>John Locke’s ideas on human nature were the basis of many ideas in the Declaration of Independence. For example, “life, liberty, and property”, later changed to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness”, was created by Locke. This
                        greatly influenced American identity and values because it defined how people fought for independence and formed an idealistic view for the people.</li>
                    <li>Second Continental Congress was a meeting in Philadelphia in which the colonies decided that they would support war against Britain. However, they disagreed on what the purpose of doing so actually was. Some wanted complete independence
                        from Britain while other simply wanted to improve relations. The struggle to figure out which solution would have the most positive impact on the colonies resulted in a split between people. This made is difficult for them to decide
                        how they wanted to handle the situation.</li>
                    <li>Thomas Jefferson was a delegate for Virginia and wrote most of the Declaration of Independence. He attempted to rally the colonies and point a finger at the king for mistreatment of the colonies. As a result, he helped increase tensions
                        between the colonies and Britain since they were breaking away from its rule. This also affected how people advocated for self-government within the colonies.</li>
                    <li>The Federalist Papers were a series of essays written under a pseudonym by Federalists Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay. They were written to defend the U.S. Constitution and explain its true meaning and virtue. These
                        essays are important contributions to modern political theory in America.</li>
                    <li>The Virginia Plan was a plan created by James Madison that proposed two legislative houses. Representation in the lower house would be based on representation and members of the lower house would be elected by the upper house. This
                        plan helped further the debate for how to run the newly independent nation.</li>
                    <li>Washington Farewell Address, written in 1797, stated that Washington would not be running to serve for a third presidency term. In his address, Washington warned people about international entanglements and conflict between political
                        parties. His address included ideas of the U.S. remaining neutral and the tensions between political parties.</li>
                    <li>Weakness in the Articles of Confederation resulted in a call for a new form of centralized government. From this, the U.S. Constitution was born. One major issue was that Congress had little authority over the states, but the Constitution
                        created three new branches of government that held more power. This contributed to the establishment of a new government within the U.S. after the Revolution.</li>
                    <li>Antifederalists believed that they were defenders of the principles of the Revolution, as the Constitution would produce a tyrannical government. Their largest grievance was the fact that there was no bill of rights and advocated for
                        a ratification of the Constitution to include one. </li>
                    <li>Federalists supported the Constitution and provided powerful counter-arguments against their opponents in order to defend the Constitution. The disagreements between federalists and antifederalists was one example of conflict between
                        parties within the U.S.</li>
                    <li>Alexander Hamilton was a political genius, lawyer in New York, military aide to General Washington, and the illegitimate son of a Scottish merchant. He was an important figure in American history and helped shape American values and
                        theories.</li>

                    <h1>Period 4</h1>
                    <h3>(1800-1848)</h3>
                    <p>Key Concept 4.1: The United States began to develop a modern democracy and celebrated a new national culture, while Americans sought to define the nation’s democratic ideals and change their society and institutions to match them.
                        <br><br> Key Concept 4.2: Innovations in technology, agriculture, and commerce powerfully accelerated the American economy, precipitating profound changes to U.S. society and to national and regional identities.
                        <br><br> Key Concept 4.3: The U.S. interest in increasing foreign trade and expanding its national borders shaped the nation’s foreign policy and spurred government and private initiatives.</p>
                </div>
                <div id='period5' class='periods'>
                    <h1>Period 5</h1>
                    <h3>(1844-1877)</h3>
                    <p>Key Concept 5.1: The United States became more connected with the world, pursued an expansionist foreign policy in the Western Hemisphere, and emerged as the destination for many migrants from other countries.
                        <br><br> Key Concept 5.2: Intensified by expansion and deepening regional divisions, debates over slavery and other economic, cultural, and political issues led the nation into civil war.
                        <br><br> Key Concept 5.3: The Union victory in the Civil War and the contested reconstruction of the South settled the issues of slavery and secession, but left unresolved many questions about the power of the federal government
                        and citizenship rights.</p>
