                            <p>Common Sense was a means of propaganda written by Thomas Paine, and it aimed to alter American outlook on the war. He wanted to show people that they should be angry at the English Constitution and the king rather than just
                                Parliamentary measures. This makes it evident that the king was an easy target for blame when the colonies wanted to easily point a finger at someone. It increased tensions between the colonies and Britain, resulting in

                            <p>Hawaii was attractive to the U.S. because it had large sugar production. The U.S. wanted to annex Hawaii and many farmers moved there to grow sugar. In 1890, the tariff exemption on Hawaii ended, resulting in high prices on
                                imports. This hurt U.S. farmers that were living in Hawaii. Queen Liliuokalani believed that native Hawaiians should control the islands, but she was overthrown, and McKinley eventually signed the treaty to annex Hawaii.</p>

                            <p>The Cuban Revolt occurred in 1895 when Cuba revolted against Spain. They followed a scorched-earth policy, meaning they destroy everything in order to hurt Spain economically. The U.S. was concerned because of investments and
                                trade. The Spanish tried to crush the rebellion and the Spanish minister spoke negatively about McKinley. The USS Maine, stationed in Cuba, blew up and killed 260 sailers. This called for U.S. involvement in the war, so
                                McKinley sent a message to Congress on April 11, 1898 urging war with Spain. The Teller Amendment promised Cubans that once the Spanish were overthrown, Cubans would gain their freedom. On August 12, 1898, an armistice
                                was signed that ended the war. About 400 Americans died during battle and 5,000 died because of disease. America gained Guam, Cuba, and Puerto Rico as a result of the war. </p>

                            <p>The Korean War began in 1950 when North Korea (Communist) invaded South Korea (not Communist). They took over almost all of South Korea, so Truman viewed this as an act of the Soviet Union. In response, the U.S. increased its
                                military size and spending. N. Korea pushed past the 38th parallel. China intervened and helped N. Korea. In July 1953, it was agreed that Korea would be divided at the 38th parallel, which would be a demilitarized zone.</p>
